This code of conduct is developed for the Fall 2020 offering of R for [Reproducible Scientific Analysis](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/) taught at the NCI.

### We aim to provide a supportive, collegial, and harassment-free environment

We are dedicated to providing a supportive, collegial, and
harassment-free workshop experience for everyone, regardless of:

-   gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
    disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion.
-   intellectual position: approaches to data analysis, software
    preferences, coding style, scientific perspective, etc.

This code of conduct applies to all workshop-related communications,
including but not limited to WebEx meetings and discussions. We do not tolerate harassment, intimidation, or bullying of students or staff. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate in communications or in online venues, including chats.

Violating these rules will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis an may be referred to [NIH Civil](https://hr.nih.gov/working-nih/civil).

### Examples of unacceptable harassment, intimidation, and bullying behavior

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

-   Making comments in chats, to an audience or personally, that
    belittle or demean another person
-   Sharing sexual images online
-   Harassing photography or recording
-   Sustained disruption of talks or other events
-   Unwelcome sexual attention
-   Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

Intimidation and bullying include, but are not limited to:

    public presentation

    or question/comment

    expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
    body size, race, age, religion, or other personal attributes in the
    context of a scientific discussion

### Meeting Recordings

Participants should be aware that sessions will be recorded
and posted on the [workshop VBrick channel](https://nci.rev.vbrick.com/#/media/all?team=fe9c8242-8aed-48b3-8fa1-9def0eb921b9).

### Enforcement

Individuals asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.

If an individual engages in harassing behavior, the instructors will work with the offender to remediate the behavior. This includes warning the offender and/or submitting a formal complaint to [NIH Civil](https://hr.nih.gov/working-nih/civil/how-can-i-report-harassment-or-inappropriate-conduct).

The instructors may take action to redress anything designed to, or with
the clear impact of, disrupting the course or making the environment
hostile for any individuals.

We expect everyone to follow these rules throughout the course and
during all course-related online activities.

### Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please
report it as soon as possible. Harassment and other code of conduct
violations reduce the value of our workshop for everyone. We want to
foster a safe, enjoyable and productive learning environment. People
like you make our program a better.

You can make a report either personally or anonymously.

#### Anonymous or Non-anonymous Report

You can make an anonymous or non-anonymous report to
[NIH Civil](https://hr.nih.gov/working-nih/civil). Each report will be fully investigated and necessary corrective action will be taken to prevent a recurrence.

You can also make a personal report to [ncibtep@nih.gov](mailto:ncibtep@nih.gov).

When taking a personal report, we will do our best to maintain your
safety and privacy. We may involve NIH Civil and/or HR to ensure your
report is managed properly. We will set up a meeting in a safe, private environment and ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we’ll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can include someone to support you. You won’t be asked to confront anyone, and we won’t tell anyone who you are. We will do our best to maintain your anonymity when addressing the incident. In the event that remediation may expose your identity, we will discuss options with you prior to taking any action.
